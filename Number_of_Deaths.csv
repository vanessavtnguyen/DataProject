1. Year refers to year of registration of death. Deaths registered in 2014 and earlier are based on the final version of cause of death data; deaths registered in 2015 are based on the revised version; deaths registered in 2016 and 2017 are based on the preliminary version. Revised and preliminary versions are subject to further revision by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2. Data for 2010 have not been adjusted for the additional deaths arising from outstanding registrations of deaths in Queensland in 2010. For more details please refer to Technical note 3 in Causes of death, Australia, 2010 (ABS cat. no. 3303.0).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"3. Rates are calculated using the sum of estimated resident populations at 30 June for each year. Rates are expressed as deaths per 100,000 population. Age-standardised rates are directly standardised to the Australian estimated resident population at 30 June 2001.",,,,,,,,,,,,
